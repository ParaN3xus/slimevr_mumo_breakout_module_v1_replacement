# SlimeVR Mumo Breakout Module V1 Replacement

Fully compatible with the [SlimeVR Mumo Breakout Module V1](https://shop.slimevr.dev/products/slimevr-mumo-breakout-module-v1-icm-45686-qmc6309) interface, with dimensions matching the width of the ProMicro nRF52840 development board for easy soldering. 

Since I have no idea how to design PCBs, the routing of this PCB was done by LCEDA Pro's auto-routing feature, but somehow it magically worked, so I guess everything is OK.
